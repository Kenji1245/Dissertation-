5 to 9	%do you know%	178	3123	1	1	09/01/2015 14:17:13	user1	Step parent - not getting anywhere with social worker	Hi there I need some advice from anyone going through step parent adoption or any solicitors. My husband applied to adopt my DD in 2015 to the local authority. It took them 1 year to allocate a social worker. We have been dealing with this social worker now for over a year and my patience is running thin. She took 1 year to interview everyone and prepare a report and we got to the stage to finally submit everything to local court but she made a mistake with dates and all got returned and all documents lost in post . She made numerous mistakes and there is constant delay. She is very nice but very inefficient and I really don&apos;t know where to take this now. It&apos;s been 2 years since we applied and application is not even in court yet. Do you know if possible for us to apply directly to court with our own statement or maybe instruct a solicitor?
