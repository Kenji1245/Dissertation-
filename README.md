# Aim of the Project
The aim of the project is to design a NoSQL Database with a user-friendly interface for easy retrieval of unstructured data.

# Introduction
This software application contains a search engine that is capable of easily retrieving unstructured data from a NoSQL Database (MongoDB). This is done by implementing a natural language processing method known as BERT to interpret information within text and retrieve it by query.

# Tools Used
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Flask (Python)
- MongoDB (NoSQL)
- XML (Extensible Markup Language)
